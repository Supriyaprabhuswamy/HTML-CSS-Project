<p>The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or petes, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagar empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was given to them as a jagir (feudal estate).The Mughals later captured Bangalore from and sold it to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore.[14] When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands.</p>
